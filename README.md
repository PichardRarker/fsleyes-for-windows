# fsleyes-for-windows
A simple .exe wrapper for FSLeyes, allowing it to be started from the Windows GUI


## Prerequisites
   1. Windows 10
   2. [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
   3. A [Windows X client](https://superuser.com/questions/99303/what-are-my-x-client-options-for-ms-windows)
   
# Install instructions
   1. After downloading the WSL Linux distribution of your choice, follow the official FSL install instructions for Windows WSL [here](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation/Windows). If you've done this previously, then a re-install shouldn't be neccessary. If you've already downloaded an X client for your windows machine, then you can skip this step in the FSL instructions: `2. Install XMING (in Windows)`
